# MEL-Fiji-Plugin

This is an implementation of the Mitochondrial Event Localiser as a plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.

## Installation

Copy the `MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar` into the the `plugins` folder of where you extracted Fiji. (e.g. C:\&lt;path-to-Fiji&gt;\Fiji.app\plugins\MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar)

This plugin relies on the [3D ImageJ Suite](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start), which can be downloaded [here](https://mcib3d.frama.io/3d-suite-imagej/). Note the version the current MEL plugin relies on is 4.0.1 which can also be downloaded from this repository (the file is called `mcib3d-core-4.0.1.zip`). Extract and copy it to the same plugins folder.

## Usage

This plugin is still under development, it should however be mostly functional even though the documentation is currently limited. We hope to improve the user friendliness of the system and have it entirely refined by the end of 2022.

Currently, the plugin can be run by selecting it under "Plugins>MEL Process" in the Fiji menu system.

If you face issues with the use of this plugin, please email me at rptheart(at)sun.ac.za

## Dependencies

This plugin relies on the mcib3d-suite to work. The appropriate version can be found as a zip file in this repository. Please extract the zip file to the Fiji plugins folder as explained above under Installation.
