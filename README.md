# MEL-Fiji-Plugin
This is an implementation of the Mitochondrial Event Localiser as a plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.

## Installation
Copy the `MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar` into the the `plugins` folder of where you extracted Fiji. (e.g. Fiji.app\plugins\MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar)

## Usage
This plugin is still under development, and is not quite usable yet without some tweaking to the code. We hope to have a working version ready by July 2021.

Currently, the plugin can be run by selecting it under Plugins>MEL Process in the Fiji menu system.

## Dependencies
This plugin relies on several other plugins to work. A full list will be provided with final release.
