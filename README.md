# MEL-Fiji-Plugin
This is an implementation of the Mitochondrial Event Localiser as a plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.

## Installation
Copy the `MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar` into the the `plugins` folder of where you extracted Fiji. (e.g. C:\&lt;path-to-Fiji&gt;\Fiji.app\plugins\MEL_Fiji_Plugin.jar)

This plugin relies on the [3D ImageJ Suite](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start), which can be downloaded [here](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/_media/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d-suite3.96.zip). Extract and copy it to the same plugins folder.

## Usage
This plugin is still under development, and is not quite usable yet without some tweaking to the code. We hope to have a working version ready by July 2021.

Currently, the plugin can be run by selecting it under "Plugins>MEL Process" in the Fiji menu system.

## Dependencies
This plugin relies on several other plugins to work. A full list will be provided with final release.
